 Title: My First module
   API: 1.0
Author: Tobias Nystrom <lejban@gmail.com>

I like to learn by example so we start with some code.

Example code:
<?php
	class helloworld extends module
    {
        var $trigger = 'hello';
        var $version = '0.1';
        var $credits = 'Tobias Nystrom <lejban@gmail.com>';
        var $usage   = '!hello';
        var $help    = 'Outputs "Hello world"';

        function call()
        {
            $this->send('Hello world');
        }
    }
?>

Save this as the file modules/custom/helloworld.module.php

Lets step through this:

# class helloworld extends module
Create the module.

# var $trigger = 'hello';
This mean that '!' + $trigger is what you will write in the IRC channel to
trigger this module, the result is '!hello'.

# var $version = '0.1';
# var $credits = 'Tobias Nystrom <lejban@gmail.com>';
This modules version and who wrote it.

# var $usage   = '!hello';
A short description on how to use this module. As our module don't handle any
arguments '!hello' is enough.

# var $help    = 'Outputs "Hello world"';
A text describing what the module does.

# function call()
This is the method that gets called when anyone write the trigger in the IRC
channel. You can put any PHP-code in this method.

# $this->send('Hello world');
This sends 'Hello world!' back to the same channel where the trigger was said.
(If anyone sent the trigger as a private message to the bot, the 'Hello World!'
is sent as a private message to that person)

That's it! Good luck, and if you write a complete module, please drop an email
to me with the code.
